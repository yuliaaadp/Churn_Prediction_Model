# Churn Prediction Model
Costumer Churn refers to when a customer (player, subscriber, user, etc) ceases his/her relationship with company.
Churn affects every customer segment, and when it creeps up to your high-value assets,
it leads to a shorter customer lifespan with the brand and reduced lifetime value.

Analyze churn as it occurs. Use your churned customers as a means of understanding why customers are leaving.
Analyze when anh how churn occurs in a customer's lifetime with your company,
and use that data to put into place preemptive measures.

Churn rate, when applied to a customer base, refers to the proportion of contractual customers or subscribers
who leave a supplier during a given time period.

So, this model show how to make a simple prediction to bank customers, whether they're churn or not.
The bankers can decide how to treat their customers based on result of prediction.
This model built in Python and used these library:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn

To build the model, used five different algorithms, there are:
- Logistic regression
- SVC (Support Vector Classifier)
- Random Forest
- KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor)
- Decision Tree

Find the best model by comparing evaluations score, which are:
- accuracy
- precision
- recall
- f1-score
- ROC-AUC
